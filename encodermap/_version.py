"""Encodermap's versioning follows semantic versioning guidelines.
Read more about them here: https://semver.org/

tldr:
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Current example: Currenlty I am writing this documentation. Writing this will not break an API, nor
does it add functionality, nor does it fixes bugs. Thus, the version stays at 3.0.0

"""

__version__ = "3.0.0"
