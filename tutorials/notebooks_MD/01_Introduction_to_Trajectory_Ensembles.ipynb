    "### Collective Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Collective Variables (CVs) are often used to simplify and filter the xyz-Data of MD simulations. They are often employed to make sense of a complex protein (or more general molecular) system by breaking it down into just a few well-defined descriptors. They are similar to reaction coordinates, which are 1-dimensional variables along a reaction pathway but can be higher dimensional. When we think about a receptor-ligand system, the distance between the two species is often used as a reaction coordinate. A set of this distance CV and the relative rotation between receptor and ligand can add much more information and help understand the system. It becomes apparent that clever selection of CVs is an important task that many scientists in different fields face day to day.\n",

    "### Example CVs\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a list of widely used CVs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distances: This category of CVs can contain a 1-diemsnional scalar value describing the distance between two species in a receptor-ligand system. A 1-dimensional CV of the end-to-end distance of a protein can describe the proteins folding state in an approximate and generalizing manner. Distance CVs can also be higher-dimensional. The pairwise distances between $\\mathrm{C_\\alpha}$ atoms of a protein with $n$ residues can be captured as a $n \\times n$ matrix. A so-called hollow matrix, where all diagonal-elements are zero which is also symmetric. Most often a vector of length $\\binom{n}{2}$ is used to describe the pairwise distances in a protein. The distance between a protein and a membrane/interface would also fall into this category.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Angles: Angular CVs lie in a periodic space of $(-\\pi, \\pi]$ or $(0, 2\\pi]$, or $(0, 360]$. The well-known Ramachandran plot uses a protein's $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ angles to define regions of $psi$-$phi$ combinations which correlate to different secondary structure motifs. Besides the backbone angles other angles can become important in understanding a protein's conformations. Lysine is often modified via acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitylation and it's sidechain angles ($\\chi_1$ to $\\chi_5$) can be important descriptors in such a system. Pseudo-Dihedral angles lie also in this category. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Integer/binary values. If a protein has well-defined states (folded and unfolder) a binary value describing these states could also be a useful CV.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Values from other calculations and hyperparameters. An example for this category could be the temperature at which the simulation was carried out, when simulations were conducted at multiple temperatures. If phase space sub states were obtained by either using Markov-Chain models, or by using some sort of clustering algorithm (GROMOS), the membership to such cluster could also present CVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positional values: Maybe even the full position of an atom or a group of atoms could be an important descriptor for a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- etc."

    "Thinking of collections of trajectories describing the dynamic phenomena of a protein as an ensemble opens up new ways of working and understanding MD data. EncoderMap's autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction builds on this framework by using neural networks to reduce the dimensionality of a input feature space. This input feature space and thus the low-dimensional representation also, contain ensemble statistics of the protein or the family of proteins we will look at.\n",

    "Using the `SingleTraj` and `TrajEnsemble` classes can help with the dimensionality reduction, but with much more of the book-keeping a computational chemist has to do. We hope the tools presented in this notebook can help you in tackling the itering protein dynamic questions you are faced with."
