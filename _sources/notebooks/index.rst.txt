Notebook Gallery
================

Here, you can find static renders of EncoderMap's example notebooks. You can run them interactively on Google Colab or MyBinder. You can also run them on your local machine by cloning EncoderMap's repository.

.. code-block::
    :bash:

    $ git clone https://github.com/AG-Peter/encodermap && encodermap
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install md_requirements.txt
    $ cd tutorials
    $ jupyter-notebook

Starter Notebooks
-----------------

The starter notebooks help you with your first steps with EncoderMap.

Notebooks MD
------------

The MD notebooks contain more detailed descriptions of how EncoderMap deals with MD data. It helps you in saving and loading large MD datasets and using them to train EncoderMap. It also helps you in understanding the terms `feature space` and `collective variable`.

Notebooks Customization
-----------------------

These notebooks help you in customizing EncoderMap. These tools can assist you in understanding how EncoderMap trains on your data. Furthermore, you will learn how to implement new cost functions and vary the training rate of the Neural Network.

Notebooks Publication
---------------------

These notebooks contain the analysis code of an upcoming publication ""EncoderMap III: A dimensionality reduction package for feature exploration in molecular simulations" featuring the new version of the EncoderMap package. Trained network weights are available upon reasonable request by raising an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/AG-Peter/encodermap/issues, or by contacting the authors of the publication.
